Joseph was enjoying his walk into the forest. All the charms of the spring were to be found there, wherever he turned his head to - plants blooming, birds chirping, a gentle wind blowing, the sun delivering welcoming amounts of warmth. Colourful, harmonious, bringing his decrepit old bones delight. "Loneliness isn't so bad in a world this beautiful." He missed his beloved Diane, even many years later, and not having any children was his biggest regret, but he decided to take this as a lesson, to always appreciate the beauties found in living, big and small.  
Suddenly, he noticed a weird bug laying on the path before him, trembling. A bug? No. Miniature human features, pink skin, dragonfly wings.  
"What are you doing so far from home, tiny one?" No reply outside of further shudders. "There there", he gently picked the creature up, looked around a bit. Oh there it is! Sour ground, a circle of mushrooms. He placed the fae in the circle, it struggled for a moment to gesticulate, then it disappeared in a flash. Joseph smiled.

A sound of knocking on the doors. Joseph slowly got up from his rocking chair and opened.  
"Good day mister Joseph!"  
"George, Felix, Amanda!" He couldn't help but smile cheerfully. The ever-vigorous youth were the most welcome presence at his homestead. "What is it that you need children? A story? Fruit maybe?" He looked at their faces and noticed them eyeing the slowly boiling cauldron. "So that's what it is" he thought. "The harvests were sub-par again. Poor children, they need proper food to grow. Good thing I'm always on a surplus."  
He filled three bowls with the stew and placed them on the table, the kids thanked the old man and began eating voraciously. The slurping, the scraping, the joy. They were done in a few moments, then they ran to wash the bowls in the nearby stream, screaming and acting silly along the way. He watched from the house's porch at the heartwarming simplicity and joy. "Such a childhood should be" he thought. "Of wonder, of happiness, of safety. A life to always look back to."  
The kids have returned, placing the bowls back into their place.  
"Thank you for the stew mister Joseph!"  
"Don't mention it, go and have fun kids!" And so they did, running, soon to blend with the setting sun. Joseph closed the door and began slowly returning to his trusty chair. Suddenly, a sound of knocking, a bit more hollow than usual. Quite a surprise, but nonetheless, the old man turned around to open. A little boy, but none his poor eyesight could recognise. Nor did he recognise the voice saying:  
"May I come in sir?"

The faeries observed, concerned.  
"It's reaching for Aelghor with his filthy hands!"  
"Calm down Kanramis."  
"Calm down?! How about we slay the giant fleshling? It has tresspassed to our forest and dares to touch one of our sacred kind!"  
"Don't you see? The spirits favor it. It is pure, one with nature. Not sparing it could be blasphemous."  
Kanramis responded by sulking, turning his back on the situation. His main source of anger was recognizing, that his friend's words were true. They are forbidden to go against the wills of the greater forces. If spirits favor the old giant, they had no choice but to honor it.  
"See? It has placed Aelghor in a circle. It's quite educated in our ways, that beast. I can't be angry at it. The main problem with humans is their inability to upkeep nature's courtesy. This creature is different. I say we reward it, favor for favor."  
The other two smiled, reading through their friend's intentions.  
"So what's the name of the demon we shall summon?"

"Abiett'okhul" the boy answered, causing the old man to go pale.  
"I dare not speak this language young man, I'm sorry. I will not use this name."  
"I see. Then give me a name you don't fear." Joseph leaned forward to look closer at the boy. Uncommonly tanned skin, quite sharp facial features, pale yellow eyes. Eyes he's never seen before.  
"How about: Pine Eyes?"  
The boy giggled. "Is that a custom around here? Naming people after their most distinct features? Kind of shallow, wouldn't you say? But then, what choice do you have. You don't know me yet, all you can see is appearance. I might as well accept the name. Pine Eyes it is, mister Joseph."  
The old man was joyous to host such a polite, yet intelligent young man.  
"So tell me Pine Eyes, what are you doing here? Where are your parents?"  
"I don't have parents. I'm searching for a place to stay. I saw children, running happily around here and I thought that maybe…"  
"Yes! Yes of course!" Joseph accepted the boy's offer with tears in his eyes, hugged him not to show that he's crying. The boy's torso was hard and rough. Like wood? The old man didn't care.  
"Welcome home, Pine Eyes."

The boy was the best companion Joseph could wish for. A spark of joy to match his own, helping with cooking and cleaning whenever needed, joining him in his habitual forest treks, playing with the village's children. He was the son he always wanted.  
Though he never could fully grasp the contrast, between how childishly playful and carefree the boy was, with how erudite and well spoken he was when it came to conversation. As if he was an impossible mixture of a child and a scholar. But Joseph wasn't bothered. People have quirks that make them different, and there was nothing about this he couldn't accept.

Another night was soon to fall. The old man rested in his bed near the fireplace, while the boy stayed away from it, not to risk accidentally charring his wooden, unfeeling body.  
"How was your day, Pine Eyes?"  
The boy smiled.  
"Absolutely excellent father. I have felt the smells and seen the colours, I have engaged in joyous nonsense with the other children. I never knew joy came in so many flavors."  
The old man laughed hearthily.  
"Yes, yes, there's always a new joy waiting to be found. Isn't that wonderful?"  
The boy sat back and relaxed.  
"I can't get enough of it."  
A moment of warm silence.  
"That's good, that's good. Goodnight son."  
"Sleep well Joseph!"  
The boy of course didn't intend to sleep. He never did. He didn't need to. Eyes forever wide open, he watched over the safety of his guardian. His guide. His friend.

The villagers have returned from their farming plots, their moods - extra miserable. Angry gossip started to spread.  
"It's the old man Joseph, innit? He'd cursed us! Our harvests to fail!"  
"Nana always told me that green-eyed men should be exiled, for the good of everyone."  
"And that weird wooden boy? That's just proof! Godforsaken witchery! He's bringing misfortune upon us!"  
"I say we go to his place and make sure he never comes back, hehehehe" said Frank, a middle-aged man with a distinct beer belly. A nearby scarecrow has creaked very loudly, grabbing everyone's attention. Not a scarecrow, that's the cursed boy! It spoke:  
"Don't you dare touch master Joseph, you villains! He's a good man. If you want someone to blame for your famine, you should look at yourselves."  
"Shut your mouth you hellish fiend" yelled Frank, then charged at the puppet with a scythe. The boy has turned his fist into a stake, impaled the man deep into his liver, then caused a sudden sprout from his limb, shredding Frank from the inside, his corpse now featuring twigs growing from orifices, and piercing through skin. Through blood's nourishment, the boy's hand regrew to its old humanoid shape. He spoke in an old tongue:  
"May this sacrifice of flesh and blood appease the soil spirits, repay the toil necessary to bear fruit."  
Then he turned to the shocked, motionless villagers.  
"Old man Joseph is under my protection. I will do you no harm as long as you don't think to threaten him. Such I swear upon all powers above me."  
The villagers scattered, their vengeful intentions - completely eradicated.

Eight years have passed. The sun has nearly completely disappeared.  
"You know, son, tonight might be the night. I can feel it" spoke Joseph, struggling, gasping and taking breaks between words.  
"Yes, I believe you… father."  
"Tell me, how is it… that you haven't aged a day?"  
"Have I not? What does it mean for a child to age, other than to learn more about the world? I have learned much, thank you. You have raised me well in your ways. But have I not aged? You might be right. As some aspects of me were created to be ageless. Does it mean they're perfected? I have no idea. I imagine you were never fooled, about me being human. I'm putting up a show. Puppeteering. Were you entertained?"  
"Entertained? I am grateful. Beautiful performance. Changed my life for the better. No matter what you are, you're a divine gift to me, my lonely soul."  
"That's the thing with you, old man. Your faith. You don't care for what I am, unlike most humans. You just care, for me. You, too, have showed me something beautiful."  
The old man smiled faintly.  
"I feel myself slipping, I think this is it. You were… the best son… I could have had…"  
Joseph's old flesh has gone limp. The boy whispered in sadness:  
"You were the best friend I could have wished for."

Eyes suddenly opening, a gasp. Head flooded with memory. Joseph, old man, dying, village. "Why am I alive, where am I?" He looked forward, just to witness an infinite, incomprehensible realm of nonsense stimuli. Among it, a majestic creature seated on an incomprehensible throne.  
"Joseph."  
"Pine Eyes?"  
"Yes. More precisely, Abiett'okhul, lord of Possession. And this" he gestured across the impossible horizon "is my court." With a snap of a finger, he's caused the space around them to warp in a kaleidoscopic blur, solidifying into familiar shapes. A wooden hut with a porch. The nightmarish creature too has warped back into the humble form of a wooden boy, smiling at the old man, who has just noticed, that he's also made of wood himself.  
"Welcome home, father."
