\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22\lang21 Foraminis was a beloved king. Some said - the best the kingdom of Lacus has seen in centuries. Kind and just to all, always seeking to find the best way to improve the livelihoods of his people, even if it meant putting in extra effort. He was a leader, not a ruler. And he knew that they knew. An anniversary speech was a grand event, but he didn't fear it, exactly thanks to that. He stepped behind the curtain, onto a balcony, and the spectacle began.\line "My beloved people! It's already been ten years of my rule. In an occasion like this, I can't help but reminisce of my mother, how she used to sew in her leisure. Once she told me: isn't it amazing, this ability? I can restructure this piece of fabric into anything I can imagine. All it takes is keeping a cool head and putting in the necessary work. The fabric itself is but a potential, it's up to me, whether I realize it or waste it.\line This is who you are! You are the fabric of this kingdom, and I'm but a humble craftsman. And I promise to keep doing my best, for this kingdom's future will be my legacy!\line I was shocked and devastated the day my father died\'85"\line "Augustus was not your father" someone in the crowd below yelled at the top of their lungs.\line "What\'85?"\line "The whore queen has dishonored the throne with pigmy blood! You're as tiny on the inside as you are on the outside!"\line They know. His worst fears have become a reality. The guards were on their way to arrest the deliquent.\line "No, leave him be" said Foraminis in sorrow. "He is speaking the truth. I'm but an impostor, I'm not the rightful king, for my blood is tainted."\line Hundreds of eyes stared at him unflinchingly in collective judgment, his frail, dwarf body started to shrink even more. His crown however has stayed the same size, at first obscuring his sight, then swallowing him whole, like a miniature palace.\line Just as he was about to shrink into nothingness, he woke up, breathing heavily. His luxury sheets were now drenched in sweat, he rolled out of the bed and opened the balcony window. Night, fresh breeze. What a relief.\line "Poor thing" he heard behind him, "that must have been the most terrible nightmare\'85"\line "It probably was. And it's probably grounded in reality" he said with a very somber, worried look. "I am cursed, destined to be an usurper to the throne. I'm not here by any divine rights, as everyone before me was."\line "The divine have let your coronation happen, and from their position, that's basically directly allowing it. And people love you. You're known as the one to bring peace and unity and you shall be remembered as such."\line Foraminis just sat there quietly, thinking. For years now, he's been using spies to take an authentic look at the social climate in his kingdom, and yes, everybody indeed loved him. Then why couldn't he get rid of this shame? He felt dirty. He felt small.\line "Don't think about it too much, sorrowful thoughts can bring you bad luck, and that's the last thing you need right now."\line "I should stop indeed. You're such a darling\'85" he said and caressed her cheek. She smiled, kissed his hand and said:\line "That's what I'm here for."\par
A few days have passed. The dwarf king has taken up a new hobby, tailoring, as a mean of relieving stress. It was a nostalgic activity, as it strongly reminded him of his mother, of her presence, which never failed to be comforting.\line "Just you wait a few months, you'll have the most varied garderobe in the world" he said to his wife, planning to sew her new dresses until he becomes a masterful craftsman. She smiled, glad to have such a caring sweetheart of a husband, but mostly relieved that he seemingly has found an outlet for his anxieties. Being a high class official makes it hard to enjoy the simple pleasures of life, so she was soaking in the moment to its fullest - cherry flowers blooming, birds chirping in a complex concert, the Wind and the Sun gently bringing comfort through their elemental influence. What a truly beautiful day to be alive.\par
The Sun has grown impatient. The Wind has finally crossed the Veil's threshold, and in a hasty whirlwind of impossible rotation made itself present in front of the Sun.\line "You're supposed to be the fastest there is."\line "I wish speed was the only factor to worry about when visiting the mortal realm. That world is nigh inhospitable in some places, you gotta move very carefully if you don't want to collapse and starve, at least when you're as powerful as we are."\line "Spare me the details Veehoorra, it's your job and I don't care. Better inform me how is the plan going."\line Now the wind god has also grown annoyed, but decided to play along anyway.\line "The seeds have been planted, the strings are being pulled. Phase two should start this mortal week, the climax - a matter of a month."\line "Excellent. Truly excellent. I am thankful to you for understanding our common interest."\line "No need to be, the other option is to be a powerless fool. And that's greatly below my ambition."\line The Sun smiled, revealing thousands of its pointy, irregular glass teeth. The smile didn't look exactly friendly, and none of them even considered believing they could become friends.\par
"My king!" exclaimed a servant as he entered the study running. "The Chief of Intelligence wants to see you urgently!"\line "Why is that?"\line "A spy has been caught."\line "Isn't that a pretty common occurrence? My presence was never necessary so far."\line The servant stood there for a moment dazed, breathing heavily.\line "He's a Black Lilly\'85"\line The king was deeply surprised, but kept himself reserved. The Black Cloth Order usually doesn't get involved in politics. And especially, they never try to engage in espionage. Was the spy's goal to assassinate him? Foraminis was full of questions.\line He stood up from his chair and nodded at the servant to prepare a carriage. With the glove he was crafting still in hand, he left the palace. The trip took them a dozen minutes. The king got off and walked promptly, greeted with respect by the guards of the office. The Chief Officer of the Intelligence department has greeted him at the door, and invited him downstairs. Foraminis worried this would be the case, but the life of the king involved also unpleasant responsibilities, so he wasn't really complaining this was happening.\line The horrid smell was what has hit him first. Blood and feces all around the torture chambers, the stench would never wash away completely. But the sight was even worse. The spy was lying there at the center table. Naked, skinned, leg and arm muscles sliced into meat slabs.\line "He seems to be dead. A pity" said the Officer. "He hasn't told us much, but he did tell something. We know his employer wanted to meet at the ruined manor in the forest the next new moon, midnight."\line The king started visibly calculating.\line "That's in a week from now" said the Officer watching the body more closely. "Ah-ha! I found what killed him. The flower!" he exclaimed and pointed at the spy's head. A black flower was sprouting from his temple. "He probably willed it into growing its roots deeper to grant him a convenient death. A cunning move."\line The king was floored by the information. He's heard the rumors about the Black Lilies, how they're fearless and seemingly immune to pain, but this exceeded all reason and imagination. The person was skinned and sliced alive, yet the thing that killed him instead was his volountary suicide. Foraminis couldn't seem to fathom that kind of surreal reality. All he could do was stare at the muscle slabs. The sheer reality of them laying there was at least wince-worthy, yet he was mostly mesmerised. After a while, he finally shook off the overwhelming feeling of loss of touch with reality.\line "We've got to make a move" he finally said. "Prepare a trap for the next new moon, we're going to meet the mysterious individual behind this all."\line The officer smiled and nodded, as this was exactly the type of approval he hoped for.\par
S\'ebnn noticed there was something different about her husband. It for sure wasn't his clothing - he wore the same type of long tunic as he'd always wear in the evening, when intending to sleep soon. It seemed to be not covering his ankles as well this time. Was it because he seemingly stood more upright? He seemed more happy. Has his tailoring therapy finally paid off?\line "You're always so caring and considerate. I'm amazed how not only does it compliment your femininity, but also strenghtens you as a ruler, for you can read the crowd far better than me, and always are able to say something that makes us favored by everyone, above all that could divide. You're not only the greatest wife I could wish for, but also a formidable empress."\line She smiled.\line "For all the happiness you've gained recently, your tongue has become dull. I do appreciate the compliment, but what you said wasn't new nor impressive."\line "Yes, you're right! I think I might be more tired than I thought I was. But at least I'm not so anxious anymore. Tailoring has truly helped me grow as a person."\line She couldn't have possibly imagined how literal was the meaning of the last sentence.\par
In the dark of the night a sound of screams could be sporadically heard. A scream of self-inflicted pain. A very hopeful, satisfactory scream.\line Deep within the necropolis there was the service room. It had all the medical tools, and more importantly, the freshest of the deceased bodies. There Foraminis could be found, extending his body with crude surgery. Slabs of meat sewn onto or under his skin. Scars, septic reactions, sickly puss. He was now roughly the size of an adult man, and the night was only getting started. The corpses around were slowly being absorbed by his mania, his humanoid form slowly degraded into a blob of flesh. Suddenly, steps. A sound of heavy heeled boots stomping on the stairs down to this room. Foraminis looked behind just has the grave ward guardian has taken the turn and witnessed him - a big, inhuman flesh slug. As he was stunned, Foraminis charged at him, and the shadows began to dance around. All according to plan. The plot has succeeded and the masters will be pleased. They laughed and shrieked, as the guardian was being attached alive to the blasphemous creature.\line "You will obey my will for I am your king. I will bring you peace and unity. I'll make sure the kingdom will stand strong, forever." Despite the reassuring words, the guardian only felt distress and despair. The king, through his hidden shame, hoped to purify his bastard flesh through the flesh of others, and become the architect of his rebirth, just as his mother before.\line "I will become one with my kingdom. I'll be the greatest king to ever live!" he screamed into the darkness, his voice becoming more demonic as he did.\line The night was still young.\par
S\'ebnn was woken up by the distant screams. She stepped onto the balcony. Pillars of smoke and fire, people running in panic. A shadowy shillouette in the distance. Closing in. Something felt off, something aside the obvious danger. The shillouette was approaching, walls crumbling under its sheer weight. As it crawled into the light, its hideous form was revealed - a mass of cojoined bodies in anguish, working together to pull itself ahead. And atop of it all, a pigmy in a crown. The creature was roughly the size of a church, grotesque and revolting. And also fascinating.\line "What in the name of Nausea is this?!"\line "I am become the true king now. The truest strength and unity. No more uncertainty. Through careful craftsmanship I've created my body, my might, my kingdom." He leaned forward, shedding more light onto his collapsed, restless face. The unhinged expression was as terrifying as it was saddening. The man she loved became the monster she feared. The air darkened unnaturally around his head, as if he was a saint of pure evil and darkness. Yet she stayed composed. He smiled a terrible smile, then reached out his hand.\line "Come with me. Become the true queen of my kingdom."\line She couldn't hold it anymore. "Never" she yelled, bursting into tears. Only now did she fully realize, that the situation couldn't be salvaged, that her loss was permanent. She started running as the palace started collapsing behind her.\par
As the new moon was approaching the zenith, Foraminis was approaching the top of the manor hill. He couldn't help but smile at the thought how his intentions and perspectives changed through the last few days. He still wanted to meet the person to hire the Black Lilly assassin, yes, but he wasn't holding a grudge, far from it. He was thankful for his destiny being pushed into place.\line He didn't have to wait long. A being of pure energy has faded into existence. It had not even vaguely humanoid features, yet the king had no trouble reading its expression. It was beaming with joy.\line "I'm glad we meet at last Foraminis. You shall know me as Veehoora, the nightmare lord of wind, the personified fear of its destructive power and the malicious whispers it can carry. It was a joy to witness your birth. You're now one of us, a Nightmare God, and soon you'll also become the Emperor of all humans. But before that, come with me, oh bringer of conquest. I shall inform you about your new ways, as you're still an infant in our world."\line Foraminis nodded, his hunger of power growing inhumanely.\line "It's not natural for your material body, but you should have developed an intuition for it by now. To cross the Veil, just focus on it and follow my steps."\line The pigmy lord has entered the hidden reality, and to his human senses it made no spatial sense. Only then did he realize the nightmarish essence that has grown within him, letting him perceive this bizarre reality and not go mad in the process. Floating around were nightmares, big and small, exchanging information, scheming, resting. Everyone livened up feeling Foraminis's presence. They examined him with utmost curiosity, some discreetly, some not.\line "Where are we going?"\line "It's time for you to meet my accompliance in the scheme that brought you here."\line Soon after they were at the destination, as space isn't that much of an inconvenience here compared to the material world.\line "Is that\'85 the Sun?"\line "Yes, welcome!" replied the Sun. "I go by many names, but my favourites are Luer and Pharr, please address me as such."\line "Does that mean\'85"\line "Yes! The sky is an illusion. I burn, I scorch, I bring disease and drought, and I'm everywhere. I'm a god for a reason."\line The giant dwarf was in awe of the revelation. He thought really hard, as if his eyes have been opened for the first time in his life again.\line "Let me put the story together. You've tormented me with nightmares to further awaken my vulnerabilities, then sent a killer just so his torture could inspire me to grow."\line "And we also planted a lot of other ideas into your cerebrum" Pharr said, smiling with no shame or remorse. "You were chosen by the divine after all, and you were chosen for greatness."\line The king was pleased to hear that kind of validation.\line "What about the stars Luer? Are you also the stars?"\line The Sun god winced slightly, but kept the act up, and answered politely:\line "No, the stars are trickery of Teneber, the goddess of darkness and the unknown. They give people a sense of familiarity, hope, safety. And nothing amplifies fear and pain as false hope does."\line "Fascinating. Careful schemers, yet hidden in plain sight. Just goes to prove mortals are idiots on a cosmic scale."\line "Oh yes they are" replied Veehoora, and Foraminis didn't even catch the disrespect directed at him.\line "Thank you both. I shall now descend back onto the earth and conquer all I come across."\line "Yes, please do. We wish you the greatest of fortunes" said the Sun, as the monstrous amalgam was fading away into the real.\line "His delusion is beyond entertaining" it said, laughing. "Bringing fear and torment to people in the name of some ridiculous grandeur. It's hard to notice the tragedy from the sheer laughability of his foolishness. An emperor of humans! Such hubris!"\line Veehoora also joined in laughter.\line "Now our plan is nigh complete. He will grow, and we'll siphon the power he unknowingly generates. With a source this potent, we shall soon overthrow the lady of darkness herself."\par
S\'ebnn has exiled herself, for the crime of not preventing the tragedy of her husband falling into the nightmarish illness. She devoted her life to pilgrimage, following the wake of destruction and despair she indirectly caused. Trying to be discrete wasn't really a challenge - not only wasn't there anyone around to witness her, often she stumbled across a freshly crafted, simple dress, left behind by the monster. She often wondered, if it still had any shred of humanity left within, and if it felt sorry for what it did. Not that she'd be able to forgive him. She didn't believe she could. Still, she longed for the good times that were lost. The only thing ahead - a long road of sorrow to be walked.\par
"You fools! You arrogant buffoons! I understand you, my sky rival, but you? A gust of wind? You're nothing compared to me! But a speck, a lackey at best! I'm am everywhere, I am everything! And I've earned my position! I am the natural state of everything. When the light dies, and believe me, it always does, only I remain. And when people push back the veil of ignorance, all that's behind is more of it. And that's all me! Did you really think a puny fleshball would be anywhere near enough to rival my sheer presence? I am the world! And I should punish you for your sheer idiocy. From now on, you shall be eaten, then spat out every few human years, just so everyone on earth can witness your humiliation, your power literally eclipsed by my inevitability. As for you, little man, where do I even begin\'85"\par
