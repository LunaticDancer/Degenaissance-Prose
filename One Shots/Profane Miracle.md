Elisa knew he was disappointed. The life of luxury and security he gave her, the never-ending balls, the unceasing adoration of everyone around her, the freedom. And her only duty - to give him an heir. The task she failed time and time again. But not for long, she thought. There's still more that can be done. All she needed was access to the forbidden archive.

It was past midnight as she observed the moon, making tripple sure it is indeed full. The moment was ripe. The ancient spirit was at her door. All she had to do was ask. With a cold, determined expression she bared herself in front of the royal size looking glass. "I welcome thee, It Which Lurks In Cold Mirrors." She bows and observes the glass pane intently, trying to mask her desperation. The surface began to fog up, which then turnt into frost.  
It's here!  
"Isn't it forbidden to summon me in your kingdom?" The deep whisper made the furniture tremble.  
"I am the queen, nothing is forbidden to me." Her unwavering resolve is met with a mocking chuckle.  
"Very well. Why am I here?"  
"I've read up on antique lore. I know that you will grant me my deepest desire and ask for nothing in return."  
"How erudite. Only a desperate person would go to such lengths. Well then, what is your wish?"  
"Do you delight in humiliation, spirit? You already know it."  
"Ever so sharp. You do know the thing you're asking for is against nature, do you not?" She was reluctant to accept the truth she suspected for so long, but still nodded slowly. "Splendid. Let's seal the deal. Give me a kiss."

"Dear heavens!" The old woman exclaimed. "You've been blessed!"  
Elisa let out a wavering sigh of relief. "Are you sure baba?"  
"Am I sure? I can already tell it's going to be a healthy boy! The goat milk divination never lies my dear." Baba Arlette beamed with joy. "Wonderful news indeed. The king will be so happy, won't he?"  
Elisa couldn't hold back her tears anymore. The old woman lent her a shoulder without a word. "After so many years... I thought it was hopeless. That I'm cursed to be barren. But the spirits showed me mercy after all..."  
"You can't hasten nature my dear. This is the way it was meant to be."  
"You're right... You're always right baba. What would I do without you."  
The wrinkly face in front of her smiled. "Us women need to stick together, queen or not. Don't forget to thank the spirits!"  

King Pumpil was seated at the head of the table, surrounded by his most honored knights and nobles, when he noticed the doors open. There she was - beatiful as ever, her black braids interlaced with loose strands flowing over her green dress, gracefully draped over her bulging belly.  
"Ah, my dear! You look gorgeous today. Please, come join us." As he gestured, one of the table servants moved the chair to his right away from the table, inviting her to sit. She smiled, evidently in a sociable mood.  
"Quite the heated discussion you were just having, eh?"  
"Nothing gets past you." He scoffs with a smirk. "As I was saying, some are born naturally noble and driven, while others are born to serve. There no shame in nature, is there?"  
Armir, the advisor, couldn't help but grimace at such thesis. "Wouldn't you say, my lord, that one's social standing is largely depending on worldly circumstances of one's birth, as opposed to innate nature?"  
Pumpil's wine-fueled laughter boomed across the hall. "Nonsense! If all people were equals in spirit, they simply wouldn't allow themselves to be subjects. But they are. Because they can't help their subservient nature. That's why the existence of king - of me! - is a necessity. Without me, so many people would be left... headless."  
"But my king! The guards militia - surely you are aware they exist to reinforce your rule. Do you really think the people would pay the tithe without a lash over their head?"
"But of course I am aware! I can't personally attend to every affair, I need someone to enforce order for me. Common people wouldn't know what to do if you didn't tell them. A good shepherd knows how to use both the carrot and the stick."  
The queen slowly mixed the wine in her golden cup, looking with slight amusement at Pumpil's antics. Nearing his forties, yet still such a child sometimes. Fatherhood is going to work his kinks out soon enough, she thought.  

She sat down in the palace garden, turning her face to the gentle sun. She then looked down at the infant in her arms, but it didn't meet her gaze. Again. As she freed her breast from her loose gown, the boy reached to nurse on it, but that was all the interest she'd get. It never looked at her, it never cried. Not even during delivery.  
Suddenly the suction stopped. It's had enough. She couldn't help her desperate smile.  

Miesk's fifth birthday. The court has gathered to celebrate the indifferent prince. Despite all efforts, the air of the party was nothing but somber. His presence felt... empty. Without interiority. Just a glassy-eyed creature, fulfilling his basest needs. But he wasn't completely lifeless. Surprisingly, he was often found to form kinship with animals of all kinds, suddenly behaving like a person again.  
People though? Still not a word spoken. Is he mute? Is he stunted? No doctor could confirm. The king sat tensely, looking over the gathering. Why did he even dare to hope things would be different today? The child was as cold and alien as ever, paying no mind to the people or the festivities. Seeing the king's agitation, everyone was hesitant to even speak. As the doors of the hall opened loudly, everyone flinched. Armir, the advisor.  
"The reports are in my king. May I?"  
Pumpil's face twists with a grimace for a brief moment, but he proceeds to wave his hand dismissively. "Might as well. What kind of news do you bring?"  
"The people are restless. Our administrative decrees have grown outdated, causing regional shortages and a rise of crime. We can't do anything without your direct involvement your highness."  
"What worth are the people if there's no royal heir capable of taking their reins." His response was sharp and bitter.  
"I know it's a burden to raise a challenged child, but you can't ignore your duties to the people my lord."  
"A burden? Did you just call your prince a burden?" He stood up, towering over his mortified servant.  
"Ah, no! I didn't mean it like that, I swear! Forgive me my lord!" Pumpil's eyes drilled right through him, with hatred so intense, it didn't seem humanly possible. The tense staredown seemed to distort time itself, just to terrorize the advisor to its fullest potential.  
"Today is a national holiday so I'll spare your life. Know my mercy."  
Armir let out a sob of relief. "Thank you your highness, you're kinder than I deserve."  
"Instead you'll spend your remaining days in a dungeon, with naught but rats for company."  
The official froze in place, the sheer shock choking up his protest. "B-but I've served you so well..."  
"You've insulted the crown. You've forgotten your place. I had a feeling you were trouble, yet decided to give you a chance regardless, but enough is enough. Guards! Take this man away."  

Armir has lost the precise count of time, but it's been almost a full moon cycle - the small air vent at the top of his wall now being his only window into outside reality. Despite the mind-numbing emptiness of the walls of his cell, he still clung to his intellect and will to preserve civility. Not becoming one with the filth was a constant challenge he stubbornly faced. As long as he kept his wits, he wouldn't allow himself to be defeated or humiliated. Not by the bumbling idiot in the throne.  
Suddenly a distant noise stirred him out of his lethargy. The wooden doors. Footsteps down the stairs. No armor to be heard in their step. Who could it possibly be?  
Orange light began to spill on a distant wall. A slim figure wielding a candelabrum. And a child? Who brings a child to a dungeon?  
"Armir." Elisa's voice broke the silence as her and the prince approached the dungeon bars.
"Your highness! What a surprise. What do I owe the visit?"  
"I'm here to reassure you. I think Pumpil wasn't just in his judgement and I'll try convincing him to pardon you. The court really needs someone of your talents right now."  
Feeling his growing leverage, he scoffs theatrically. "Well I'm glad at least one of you two has your wits about you. What puzzles me right now is - why is the young prince here? Getting used to the reality of filth?"  
"He... just decided to follow me, on a whim. His motives continue to perplex me."  
As she lowered her hand to shed more light on her child, she noticed the prince is already squatting on the floor, seemingly playing with something. Taking an even closer look she noticed... a rat. Of course.  
"Miesk, don't touch the rats, they're dirty and likely diseased." She scolded him, devoid of any expectation he would listen. But the result was more surprising than anything she could expect. The child began to hum a strange melody which neither of them have heard before. Both adults looked on in dead silence, both understanding the weight of the moment. The mute child, giving out silent gasps and grunts at most, suddenly used its voice in a much more human capacity. Neither of them had any idea what to think of it. As he continued his melody, more rats began to gather. Calm. Obedient...? The adults couldn't even begin to understand what's going on. After a few moments the song stopped and the rats dispersed. As the boy stood up, he wouldn't even grace them with a glance.  
The stunned silence lasted a minute more, neither of them knowing what to say.  
"I just... don't understand." The woman shook her head.  
"I think you've been consulting the wrong kinds of healers. There's something unnatural going on with this child. I don't know where to even begin to look for a cure for something this... bizarre."  
"Getting you to search for answers sounds like the perfect excuse to convince the king to pardon you. There's hope for you yet."  
Armir smiles. "Oh how I sometimes wish that you were the king instead."  

Elisa was relaxing in the royal bedchambers, reading, when she heard a distant tumult. Faint clatter and screaming. Pumpil didn't seem to notice yet, or maybe he just didn't care. "Maybe for a good reason" she thought. "Whatever it is, the guards will sort it out."  
But the noises only became louder. Just as she started the worry, the bedroom doors burst open, a guardsman tumbling onto the floor with just one desperate word:  
"Run!"  
As the word left his throat, his body was rapidly covered by a living coat of ashen dark fur. A swarm of rats began eating him alive, quickly exposing his bones. Closely behind the swarm, a boy followed, ominously floating above the ground, humming a foreign melody. After entering the room it spoke, but the voice did not at all resemble that of a child - it was a deep whisper, causing the walls to quiver with its unearthly resonance.  
"Good evening... mother." The child resumed its hum, and the swarm of rats immediately shifted its attention to the king. Pumpil, understanding what's about to happen, began to scream.  
"No! You can't! You can't do that! I'm the king! I am the king!!" His denial lasted for as long as his flesh allowed it to, before his body lost all motion. For contrast, Elisa had none of such fighting spirit in her. Deep in her heart she knew this moment was bound to come. In a way, she was relieved the dread was over. She closed her eyes peacefully and let the moment pass.  
"You knew better than to let me in, yet you still did. You poor, poor thing. This is mercy, isn't it?"  
She did not grace it with an answer.  

The succession of Pumpil the Terrible by Miesk the Silent is hardly left unmentioned by any worthwhile chronicle - an event so extraordinary, it caused many to question its historical validity. A premature death of a universally hated king caused by a mysterious rat infestation, followed by an age of prosperity, lead without uttering a word. Pumpil's legacy forever stained beyond redemption, existing only to be overshadowed by his successor. Some went as far as to call it divine justice.  
But there's also an untold side to this story - rumors of an advisor holding power even greater than the king himself, governing from the shadows. What's even more mysterious is how he survived the massacre. His own recorded theory was that by still being imprisoned at the time, he avoided his gruesome fate through sheer familiarity he's earned among the rats. The truth, though, is anyone's guess, which is so often the case with time-worn legends.
