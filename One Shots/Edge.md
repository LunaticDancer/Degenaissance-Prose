Princess Lepidia loved the ocean. Beautiful, ever moving, mesmerizing, yet always cold and unexplored. Never lacking depth, never lacking new surprises. As she stood atop the balcony, she was glad the summer palace was the place where treaty negotiations will be made.  
While the perspective of peace between Lucilinburhuc and Arktarkras was of course great, she couldn't bring herself to care much about it herself. The royal lifestyle has proven itself to be too… sheltered and uneventful to satisfy her youthful yearnings.  
She took a one last whiff of the salty breeze, then turned around into the palace halls - the court meeting was about to begin soon, and it would be extremely untactful not to arrive reasonably on time, so however she hesitated, she had to abandon her relaxation for now.  
The labirynth of masterfully decorated halls echoed with her footsteps as she took her time strolling through them, looking around, admiring. The walls were sculptured in flowery patterns around the stained glass windows and numerous paintings. Art pieces upon art pieces. She didn't even realise the obscenity of the splendor she was experiencing, but she sure did appreciate the beauty of it.  
While indeed she was looking around, she failed to ever consider looking up. Not because of the beautifully painted over, arched ceiling, but because of a man, dressed in black, waiting for her. As she was passing under him, he fell onto her, stabbing a dagger deep into her shoulder. She screamed, they both collapsed onto the floor. Still screaming in her agonizing pain and dazement, she saw them - his eyes. Light blue and cold like the northernmost glacier, his pupils narrow, aware, full of murderous intent. Two circles of unnatural clarity in the uncertain ocean of the real. The predator and the prey, they spent a little eternity in this painful, intimate moment of anticipation, where she can only wait for him to finish his job.  
Suddenly, a tremble. The assassin looks up, then immediately rolls away from her. The court wizard has arrived. As the wizard hurls an incomprehensible mass of energy, the intruder uses the dagger to shatter a stained glass window in the image of a unicorn, then jumps through it, disappearing in the vast ocean below the cliff face.  
Her wound gushed with every heartbeat. The wizard quickly ran to her and kneeled in the rapidly growing pool of blood.  
"Shhh, shhhh, it's okay now, we'll fix you up."  
He's put his hand gently on her bleeding shoulder, then used his magic to cauterize it, causing her to feel unspeakable burning pain. And so, she screamed again.

"You're finally awake."  
Consciousness filled her body very slowly. Senses slowly coming to her. Around her, the familiarity of her bed. In front of it, king Olliander.  
"Father… What happened?"  
As her vision became clearer, she saw the expression in his face. Concern. Sorrow. Unspeakable, yet undirected hatred.  
"There… was an attempt…" his face winced in discomfort. "Someone's tried to assassinate you."  
"Who? Why?" She couldn't fully fathom the meaning of his words.  
"We don't yet know. The investigation is already ongoing, but it hasn't been fruitful thus far." A bitter pause. "How are you feeling..?"  
She moved around a bit, soon to inhale sharply through her clenched teeth.  
"All is well, but the shoulder hurts if I put it in just the wrong position."  
His posture became a little bit less tense.  
"I'm glad… I'm glad the aftermath wasn't more catastrophic for your health."  
She smiled.  
"You're more than a person. You're my daughter… But also a princess. A symbol. You're the future of this kingdom. You're a living manifestation of our people's hope. Pure and innocent. If you were to die, hope would die with you. The people would grow restless. Whether it was an inside job or Arktarkrasian hostility, the goal was to destabilize the monarchy. Whoever did this, is now a primary enemy of the state. It seems there are harsh times waiting ahead.  
Better rest sweetheart."

Many days have passed. Not many clues have been found. What was known? The assassin originated from the Black Lilly citadel. Trained and specialized in murder. Their services weren't cheap. Someone really wanted her dead.  
The assassin was aiming either for the neck or for the heart, but miraculously failed to hit either.  
She couldn't stop reliving that fateful day in her head. Sharp breathing, sharp pain, sharp clarity. His blue eyes, like ice, like ocean. She loved the ocean. Vast, mysterious, dangerous, indifferent. You can never see through its depth. You can never learn its secrets. Roaring. Mocking. The ocean was always there, larger than anyone, inevitable. Beautiful. Thrilling.  
Bested by curiosity, she's entered the royal library. The B Index Book. "Black Lagoon", "Black Leopard"… ah-ha! "Black Lilly". Seems like all she needed now was some paper, a needle and a dove. A letter marked with blood is all it takes.

She lied in her bed, restless. The full moon was shining through the ever so slightly opened window, the ocean below was doing its usual incomprehensible noises. Loud enough for her not to hear anyone approaching. She smiled to herself.  
Soon enough, the window's frame creaked, barely audibly. A dark figure leapt at her, but she rolled away, falling onto the luxurious, carpeted floor. The assassin didn't waste any time, using the landing momentum to chase her. She fought for her life, laughing. He hesitated. Then, a realisation.  
"You… You are the employer." She laid on the floor while he sat on top of her, ready to strike and end her life. "Why? Why would you try to assassinate yourself?"  
She reached with her hands, embracing the back of his head, pulling his head to her. After a short moment, he stopped resisting. Time itself started to slow down the closer they were. The warmth. A kiss. Her delicate lips releasing all her pent up excitement onto him. After a long moment of passion she finally said.  
"I've learned something that day. The day you first tried to end me." Her light-brown eyes pierced his with unsettling confidence. "You're not truly living unless you're facing death. Right at the edge of oblivion. The life I have lived until then was… artificial. All around me, only grandiose art, rules of etiquette, tradition and symbolism. But this? This is real."  
She guided his dagger-wielding hand to her throat.  
"What's your name, death dealer?"  
"Cipiter, your majesty."  
Her hand caressed his tensed stomach muscles, wandering towards his trousers.  
"Now, fuck me Cipiter. This is an order" she said, winking playfully.  
And fuck they did.

"It was the Arktarkrasians I tell ya!"  
"Arktarkrasians? Why would they? Just as they came to sign a peace treaty? Sounds very wasteful to come if that was their plan all along."  
"How empty is your noggin, Gertob? Of course they came, to not be immediately suspect after the incident."  
"My noggin is alright, thank you very much! Well they wouldn't be suspect at all if they didn't start peace negotiations in the first place AND THEN went for the assassination. Simple thought, you dimwitted twat!"  
The two gate guards were about to throw hands, but were interrupted by a horse galloping in-between them. On the horse - a warrior in black robes. And a lady?  
After a night spent doing what's forbidden, she felt like she just couldn't go back to the fascimile of life she lived before. So she left it behind. Adventure. Excitement. Danger. She shivered at the thought, even caught herself biting her lower lip a bit. Hugging her savior from behind, she noticed a black flower in his hair.  
"Is this the black lilly?"  
"It is, indeed."  
"Why are you wearing it?"  
"Wearing?!" He laughed loudly. "Oh no no sweetheart, I am not wearing it. It is grown into my head."  
"What? Why?"  
"It's a crucial part of being a Black Lilly. We plant these cursed flowers into our skulls. They make us vicious, fearless, efficient. Less human." There was a tiny twinge of sadness to be felt in the last sentence. "That's why we're the most luxurious killers one can buy. And, of course, that's where the name came from."  
"Does it hurt?"  
"It doesn't now, but it hurt as all hell when the flower was first inserted into me."  
"Why does anyone even join your order? It sounds like a terrible life to live."  
"Some are murderous lunatics trying to get paid for what they are predisposed to do. Some are desperate for money. But in most cases, it's the parents - completely out of money, unable to provide for their child, they sell the child to the citadel. The parents escape their poverty, if for a moment, and the child gets a second, unlikely chance at a life… or at least something that imitates life." A pause. "I am of the last sort."

After a three day horseback voyage, they finally made it to the citadel. Black banners depicting a skull overgrown by flowers hung on the both sides of the gate. Cipiter pulled a rope, a bell chimed in a distance. Soon after, the gate was opened by a guard.  
"Heil Proeli brother."  
"Heil Proeli indeed. Anything's changed in the past week?"  
"Not much really. We're expecting some more odd jobs, now that another war seems to be approaching."  
"War you say? Ah well, money's always good."  
They both laughed, Cipiter rode on ahead. Left the horse in the stable. Then they approached the main square. A simple space, paved with the same boring cobblestone, but with black lilies growing here and there in designated, exposed soil. Among several warriors minding their own bussiness there seemed to be someone of higher importance, as evident by their armor being more ornate.  
"Heil Proeli, master Caedis."  
The middle-aged man looked up, assessed the situation in confusion, then soon after drew his saber.  
"Give me a good reason not to kill you here and now, you walking pile of disappointment."  
Cipiter stood unbothered by the sudden danger.  
"This is my client."  
Caedis stopped in place, confused again.  
"Did she-"  
"Yes."  
Hesitantly, Caedis sheathed his weapon back.  
"Why is she here?"  
"Not really clear to me either. But sounds like she might want to become a recruit."  
"Does it now…"  
The man assessed her thoroughly.  
"There's some spark. There's something familiar and something unhinged. She has more murderous potential than she allows herself to betray, that's for sure.  
Alright. She may stay. And don't think I'm not seeing through your true intentions, young man."  
Cipiter blushed a little in embarrassment.  
"Off you go, you're spoiling our focus."  
And so they did, now heading to his personal chamber.  
"What was that attack about?" asked Lepidia, absolutely clueless.  
"There's a rule in this order, the One Chance Rule. You're allowed to fail a job only once. The next time you fail, someone else from the order is to kill you on sight. And the thing with me is, I've failed my job already. On you."  
"Oh I'm just the one for you" she laughed. "Destiny."  
He slapped her across the face.  
"This is not funny!"  
Her face now covered with hair, she gasped. Looked as if she was crying. He reached for her cheek.  
"I'm sorry…"  
"Don't be sorry." Her face, unveiled again, was red with arousal. "Be rough."  
They stumbled into his chamber, not to leave anytime soon.

"Highborn people often assume deer aren't a danger. I mean, they're a grazing animal, hunted very often, must be easy, right?  
Well, what they fail to realize, is that these animals are still massive. Their horns are at least a sword's length on top of that. Deer can be fierce and majestic, so whatever you do, don't underestimate them. Got it?"  
"Of course." She's been reading through the Citadel's library in the last few weeks, and she just couldn't wait to try her murder skills in practice.  
They both kneeled atop a hill, wind blowing at their faces, observing a lone stag drink from a pond. "Alright, remember your archery training" she thought to herself. "Steady breath, steady hand. Slow draw. Don't lose sight, don't lose aim. You're working with a thirty meters distance and a straight opposing wind." A moment of focus. The air whistled quietly. A hit between the ribs, the right lung guaranteed to be punctured. Panic and running. "This is not enough". Another arrow. "Steady. Aim several degrees ahead." Release. Puncturing the guts through the lower back. The animal trips and falls over.  
"Well the hard part is done. Now to finish it off."  
As she approached the stag, the wind started turning into whispers. "Turn back. You don't belong here. Abandon the path while you can." But she was too thrilled to consciously register the voices. She used the hunting knife to swiftly slit the deer's throat. After a final gasp, the animal was motionless.  
He caressed her cheek.  
"Clean work, darling."  
He panicked a little after noticing, that his hand left a bloodstain on her face. When she noticed, she chuckled. He laughed soon after. But she… couldn't stop. She kept laughing, willing or not, and the voices in the wind laughed with her. To stop herself, she grasped him and started kissing.  
_"It's too late. What's done is done. The threshold was crossed. White will be stained black, never to return."_

She sat behind him on a saddle. She wanted to see the ocean again, it's been some time and she's been longing. The sun was slowly setting in-between the trees.  
"There's one thing you never told me."  
"What is it, your highness?" Him acknowledging her royalty was, of course, a joke. Many weeks spent in the citadel made her believe in many aspects of their creed, among them - that everyone's equal before death.  
"Why did you miss, the first time? I know you're perfectly capable of a quick and clean kill. Why didn't you do it?"  
"When I saw you then, I was overwhelmed by your beauty. So much so, that my willingness to kill has completely faded away. And what do you know, not killing you then gave me the best few weeks of my life. You're a treasure."  
Her voice soured a little.  
"So it was all insincere? You never meant to kill me?"  
"Of course not silly! I couldn't be with you when you're dead."  
His jovial laughter was cut short by his throat being slit open.  
"You truly are a disappointment" she said, the coldness of her voice scared him more than the fact that he was helpless and about to die in a few minutes.  
As for her, she truly was disappointed. The charming facade of a cold, mysterious killer - gone. The oblivion she stared into this whole time - a fabrication. Her excitement - meaningless. The magic was lost. Innocence sacrificed for nothing. Her bitterness was too overwhelming to let even a shred of forgiveness bloom. But what about other things?  
She used her hunting knife to carve out a piece of his forehead. The black flower was freed from his unworthy flesh. She used the knife to prick the side of her head, then let the flower settle. The unbearable pain of the roots swerving through her flesh and bone - she didn't even mind. All she felt was a primal need. Primal hate. She needed to be at the edge of death. And she knew just the place.

Lucilinburhuc. Arktarkras. Two formidable military forces standing in anticipation, opposed to one another. Tens of thousands of men ready to charge.  
"Today, history will be made."  
The generals had no idea how simultaneously right and wrong they were.  
A signal from the scout. All clear. No ambushes, no archers on the side. This is a clean army on army battle. The Lucilinburhucian general nodded in response.  
"Get ready! Running foot forward!" The legion stomped as one. "Charge!!!"  
And so, a front of spear and halberd wielders swarmed the field. The Arktarkrasian front responded soon after. Steel clashed. Screams filled the air. Bodies dropped, soon to fertilize the earth beneath. Suddenly, a new signal from the scout. A lone rider, approaching from the east. The general used his binoculars to look. There was indeed a rider. A woman? What's her allegiance? What is going on?  
She rode right into the clashing point between the two armies. Soon, she jumped off the horse, ditching it, and started killing indiscriminately. As more and more fell, she laughed louder and louder, and the nature all around seemingly laughed with her.  
"She's out of her mind! She's cursed! She's possessed!"  
The soldiers of both sides started fleeing in panic, completely forgetting their duty. But it was far too late. The girl was nimble and unencumbered with armor. They fell prey to her, one by one.  
Hearing the unusual ruckus, king Olliander stepped onto the hastily built wooden watchtower, to also take a look at the situation. Alas, observing what's happening didn't clarify anything.  
"General Aetrinn, what's going on?"  
"A possessed woman appeared out of nowhere, started killing everyone."  
"She isn't even armored! How is she still alive?"  
"Some real dark magic seems to be taking her side. Seeing her fight - a truly fearsome sight to behold."  
The Lucilinburhucian army was soon to reach the outpost, with her right behind them. The king drew his sword, and stood as an exemplar of bravery, a champion to inspire his people. Whoever the girl is, she will face his might. As the girl ran at him, she collapsed before reaching him, crawling and crying. The guards readied their spears to pierce her from multiple sides. She looked up, her face running with tears and snot.  
"Father…?"  
He immediately let his guard down.  
"Put away your weapons!"  
Among soldiers, murmurs could be heard.  
"The princess was found? After all these months? What happened? How is this possible?"  
"Father…"  
"I'm here, come to me."  
"NO!" She hastily crawled away from him.  
"What's the matter? You're home. You're safe with us."  
Her hands grasped her head, tensed.  
"No, no, no no no! No!" Everyone looked in confusion. "No! Don't make me do this! Not this!" Her whole body was trembling with effort. The wind laughed, for everyone to hear. "RUN!" she screamed, in an inhuman voice.  
"Run" mocked the wind. Everyone started backing away, but far too slow, far too late. She jumped onto General Aetrinn, biting deep into his throat, then started chasing the king on all fours, running inhumanely fast. Soon after she tackled him, she used a nearby shield to bash his head in. In a brief moment of regained control, a shrill scream pierced the skies. "Why?! WHY?!"  
"Oh you wish to know. You truly do. Child."  
"Show yourself, demon!"  
"As you wish."  
Laughter reverberated all around. Patches of grass started shaking all around. Movement, noise. Something arose in the air. Multiple small creatures. Miniature humans… with wings? The fae.  
"What is the meaning of this?"  
"Do you really not realize, human? Craving oblivion so desperately, clinging to the mystery of the other side, the coldness, the reality, the intimate moment. You're insane. Misguided. Lost. There was still a chance for you, there was still time. We gave you a chance to turn back, but you WANTED to be guided right under Proeli's service. So now, serve, princess. The lost child has been delivered. The white rose has been stained. It is done. This is your life now."  
"No, please, please! Set me free!"  
The fae circle laughed. "What's done is done."  
"Please! Prevent me from doing harm! Absolve me of my sins!"  
The laughter intensified.  
"Is this what you wish for?"

"Somewhere far away, in a field, in the middle of a forest that belonged to a kingdom long forgotten, there lives a beautiful, unique flower. One of a kind. It is told, that inside it rests a doomed soul. The soul will be set free once the flower produces fruit."  
One of the kids grew sceptical.  
"But grandpa, flowers produce fruit every year. Surely, the soul was freed long ago."  
The old man chuckled.  
"Oh no, it's not that simple. The flower takes unusually long to grow, it can go many years without even sprouting. And once it finally does, someone eventually shows up to pick it. And the flower grows anew, starting the whole ordeal all over again."  
"So the flower will never be free?" a little girl asked.  
"Not as long as human greed prevails. For, since it was created, there was always someone who wanted to be the proud owner of it. The Gossamer Rose. The one of a kind flower. Does it mean anything to own it? No, not really, it's a flower with no extraordinary qualities. Do people still do it? Without fail."  
The children started nodding, grasping the wisdom of the tale. The old man looked into the fireplace, the wood crackled audibly.  
"Fire. Humanity is like a fire. Under a degree of control, it's majestic and powerful. Unrestrained - it's destructive, indiscriminate, and will eventually consume all. Passion and desire are what has driven humanity for centuries, but don't you ever consider giving up your humanity for them. Once in motion, that fire can never be stopped."
