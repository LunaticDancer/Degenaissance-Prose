\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22 Ahraan felt the earth tremble. Alerted, he looked back. A human child prancing carelessly. He couldn't help the sudden grin. He flew up on his moth-like wings, right in front of the little girl's face.\line "What is your name youngling?"\line The child's face lit up after noticing the mysterious tiny man.\line "A talking bug?!" She immediately proceeded to try catching him, her hands flailing around in awkward attempts at grasping while she started her chase.\line "Woah, stop it this instant!" Ahraan yelled, only to be completely ignored, as he flew for his life. The child ran and laughed, eventually dropping her rag doll toy on the ground without even noticing. Ahraan has had enough, deciding to resort to drastic measures. But right before he could turn his intent into a spell, a voice spoke in his mind: "You will not kill the young one, for that is against Nature's will. Try it and I will kill you myself, a five times over." Ahraan gritted his teeth and clenched his fists, denied the sweetness of his revenge by his Elder. Forced to change his plans, he flew up, curled into a ball and used the dust of his wings to turn invisible, finally evading the child. "You will come to rue this day, humanling" he thought to himself as he flew back to safety of his nest.\par
Gertrude heard the very familiar creaking of the doors behind her and her face became slightly more cheerful.\line "You're back Natalie. Just in time, the stew will be ready soon."\line "Mom, I almost caught a talking bug!"\line The woman suddenly turned around on her heel, her face paler than usual.\line "Did you speak to it?!"\line The child shrugs in confusion, surprised to see her mother worried. "I chased after it, I didn't think to talk... Have I done something wrong?" The woman laughs in relief.\line "No sweetie, you did the exactly right thing. Remember, avoid talking to strangers, especially if they don't appear human, alright?" Gertrude hugged the little girl tenderly.\line "Was the bug dangerous?" Natalie mumbled into her shoulder.\line "Yes, most likely. It was a demon in disguise, there to steal you and do Madness knows what after. But you're safe now, you clever thing" she smiles and ruffles her hair, making sure not to scare her too much. "Hope you're hungry."\par
Little Marcel was intrigued, as Natalie's behavoir was odd even for her standards.\line "What are you doing?"\line She gave him a slightly irritated look, as if it was so obvious there was no point in asking. "I'm dancing with Mister Stofeles, we're celebrating" she responded, the continued to spin around with her rag doll.\line "Celebrating what?" The boy was beyond confused.\line "Mom said I almost caught a demon" she responded smugly, basking in just how impressive that sounds.\line "Oh for real?? And what happened?" The boy became fully invested in an instant.\line "It crumbled into dust before I could catch it" she sighed. "Now that you know now, you should join our celebration." She reached out to him.\line "Umm, I can't really, I should be returning back home..."\line "Oh come on, dance with me!"\line Despite his reluctance, he found himself joining the fun, holding hands with both the girl and the doll. As they went on, they started giggling, immersing themselves in the simple joy of jumping in circles. Gertrude, noticing the noises right out her window, curiously stepped outside.\line "Oh, seems like you two are having quite the little party together." She chuckles at the adorable sight.\line "Yes, come dance with us mother!"\line Before she knew it, she became part of the prancing circle.\line As the sun came closer to setting, the number of participants grew, all laughing and dancing. All unable to stop, their growing horror trapped in their minds, as nothing but laughter left their mouths.\line "Okay, that's enough, I'm tired" said Natalie, but the dancing continued. Assuming noone's heard her, she tried again. "Mom, I'm tired." No response but laughter. Feeling something is off, the little girl began to struggle to free herself, but to no avail.\line "Stop dancing!" she yelled, which made most of the people fall to the ground, some of them unconscious, all of them very tired. \line "What was that? why did nobody listen...?" She whimpered then started crying. Gertrude approached her, still trying to stabilize her labored breathing.\line "It seems like the demon left its mark after all."\par
Little Natalie hugged her doll tightly as they crossed the wise woman's threshold. There were multiple people present - some concerned, some angry, all mulling over the events of the yester day. She felt their eyes on her and felt guilty without fully understanding why. The tall old woman on the opposite side of the room smiled and approached her, graciously moving between numerous herbs hanging from the ceiling. She spoke:\line "No need to frown little one. This won't hurt. You'll be alright." There was something hypnotic in the cadence of her voice. "Tea?" She gently offered a steaming wooden goblet. The girl only then realized how thirsty she was. With slightly shaking hands, she took the brew and sipped silently. The taste was unusual but not entirely unpleasant. As she finished her drink the woman smiled again. "Look at you, taking your medicine without a fuss." Next, she took the ornate amulet hanging around her neck and placed it on the girl's chest. "Speak your name." \line After a moment of silence, the girl spoke: "...Natalie?" The old woman laughed warmly.\line "You seem to be alone in your body." She looked up at the people who were still eyeing the girl suspiciously. "No demon lives inside this girl."\line Gertrude sighed in relief. The girl, still scared and confused, hugged her doll again. The wise woman suddenly got a hunch, turned to check something in her leather-bound codex. "May I?" She asks Natalie, reaching out with her hand to grab Mr Stofeles. The girl hesitantly handed the toy over, which was then put in-between three scented candles forming a triangle, then touched with the amulet. "Speak your name."\line "Ashtarmaa" the voice boomed suddenly, catching most of the observers off-guard, making them flinch.\line "What is your bussiness Ashtarmaa?"\line "The fae have forced me into this... object. I can't leave until it is destroyed."\line "I order you not to torment the people of this village."\line "I can't stop, it's part of the curse."\line "Obey Ashtarmaa!"\line "Your mastery of the cosmic tongue is not enough to overwhelm their command. No mortal can break fae magic, witch."\line The unrest among the people grows. The old woman takes her time to think about her next step.\line "What is the nature of the curse?"\line "When the owner of this toy asks someone to play, the other person is unable to refuse. I must ensure that with all my might." The old woman nods.\line "So we should be safe once I hide this toy away" the woman summarized calmly. The voice from inside the doll chuckles.\line "Foolish woman, the child will still own the toy, hidden or not. I don't need to be close for the curse to continue."\line "Show some respect to our priestess, demon!" Yelled Daria, Marcel's mother, visibly agitated by the whole situation.\line "I shall not speak with you, vermin."\line Daria's had enough. Before anyone could react, she cut the doll in half with an axe she's found leaning by the wall.\line "No!" The old woman exclaimed, but it was too late.\line "A...hahaha... Ha... Haha. HAAAHAHAHAHA!" The room trembled as the nightmare creature materialized before them - an evershifting tangle of hands suspended in the air. "Oh-hoho, I did not expect this to be so easy. All thanks to you." The creature pointed at Daria. "I shall relish torturing you."\line The priestess drew a ceremonial dagger, but before she was able to use it, the monster snapped its fingers and caused her body to contort painfully into a kneeling position, causing her to tremble. The monster snapped again, using more of its hands this time, which caused everyone in the room to enter a similar state. Everyone with the exception of Natalie.\line "Oh, how amusing. It seems like the fae magic still prevents me from laying my finger on you."\line "Let them go demon" the girl commanded with a trembling voice.\line "You have no authority over me, girl. You are weak and alone. I will slowly kill everyone you know and love, and I'll make you watch helplessly as I do it." The nightmare monster was beyond delighted with the pure dread it has instilled in her. She couldn't hold back her tears anymore. The creature basked in the bliss of absolute victory. Then suddenly, the girl came up with an idea.\line "Let's play a game."\line "What?"\line "We will play a game. If I win, you'll let everyone go unharmed and serve me for as long as I live" the little girl spoke with newfound determination.\line "There needs to be an exchange. You can't demand a wager without offering anything equally valuable in return. Your game is not acceptable." The monster replied calmly, confident that the child is now out of options.\line "If you win, you can take me away with the rest of them." The trembling was completely gone. The nightmare only then realized just how much control over the situation she has.\line "Damn it. Curse you Ahraan!" The floating mass of limbs shuddered in impotent rage, making all of its captives moan in pain. After a moment, it calmed down. "So then... what's your game, little girl?"\line "On the count of three we run to that tree over there. The one to reach it first wins."\line "That is quite a simple game. So be it."\line The girl readied herself to run.\line "One. Two. Three!" As she started running, the monster flew past her with ease, reaching the tree before she was even halfway done. Its manic laughter boomed across the mountainside as she kept going. A few moments later, she touched the bark.\line "Oh you stupid little thing, did you really think this would be a challenge for me? Prepare yourself for the unspeakable pain to come."\line "Oh no Mister Stofeles, you prepare yourself. I've won."\line "Is this a pathetic attempt at humor? I don't have time nor patience for that." The creature snapped its fingers, but Natalie remained unaffected. It tried again. It didn't work again. "What's happening?"\line "The game was to run towards the tree, remember? You never used your legs. You never ran. So you being first doesn't count."\line The realization gave Ashtarmaa a sinking feeling in its innards.\line "It's time Stofeles. Fulfill your promise. Let everyone go." The nightmare had no choice but to obey. "As punishment for hurting my people, you will become a toy again."\line Meanwhile, the first person has emerged from the witch's house. Gertrude. She smiled and ran towards her daughter. "You saved us! You were so brave." She began smothering her with her tender embrace. "And would you look at that, you actually captured a demon this time. That calls for a real celebration, wouldn't you say?"\line The girl's face lit up. "A celebration? Are we gonna eat pork?"\line The mother began laughing in tears, letting out the deluge of emotions - love, relief, genuine amusement. She could not believe her six summers old child just saved everyone from an unspeakable evil. She looked at her as if she was looking at the most precious treasure. "That's my girl."\par
In the unforgiving lands of Arktarkras, deep within the Tratar mountain range, there was a humble village. Its proper name - Melihea - known only to locals and the most ancient among cartographers. Its beautiful wooden buildings were particularly impressive due to ornate carvings covering their surface and tall, majestic roofs, designed with the purpose of having snow slide right off as opposed to gathering on top and collapsing the building. Outside of a few animals, the settlement had no signs of aggriculture, as both the soil and the climate made it impossible to grow crops, necessitating foraging, hunting, or if that's out of the picture - robbing outlanders.\line In the dense forest below the village there was a hidden camp of foreign warriors of Lucilin origin.\line "Get ready men, tonight we strike." The commander spoke, his voice authoritative but cautiously restrained not to be too loud. "Our scouts have confirmed that all men have left to plunder, leaving the village undefended."\line "Only women and children left? This is going to be fun" one of the soldiers remarked, giving meaningful looks to his comrades. The superior picked up on his sinful enthusiasm, but decided it's more beneficial not to scold him, as he could tell that attitude was shared by the majority. The last thing he needed right now was mutiny.\line "Indeed, today is the day our travel finally pays off. We will kill and we will take, to protect our families and our glorious nation."\line "Hail!" The row of soldiers saluted. The commander barely held back a proud smile.\line "Alright, that's enough. Now ready yourself for the evening."\line As the soldiers scattered, noone's noticed the small presence making its way through the bushes. Soon after, the figure emerged and proceeded towards the center of the camp. A little girl holding a stitched up doll. The commander smiled in grim amusement.\line "Are you lost, little girl?"\line "No, I came here to play with you." The commander made a deep chuckle, the soldiers began observing from the sidelines.\line "Oh really? And what's the game?"\line "Hide and seek. I'll count to ten." She covered her eyes up and started counting. The soldiers nodded to one another and started approaching, surrounding her in a circle, some taking their weapons with them.\line "...Nine. Ten. Ready or not here I come!" Before she was able to uncover her eyes, every soldier was instantaneously swallowed whole by the dirt beneath their feet, trapped in the suffocating blackness, unable to even scream and beg for their freedom.\line After returning back home, she was really surprised how happy everyone was about her not finding anyone.\f1\lang21\par
